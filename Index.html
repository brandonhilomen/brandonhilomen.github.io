    <h1>Brandon Hilomen's Thoughts on Alexander Pope</h1>
    <p>While watching a video about the origin of a name, I learned about one of the most quoted individuals in the english language, 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Pope" title="The Mozilla homepage" target="_blank">Alexander Pope</a>. 
	<strong>Alexander Pope</strong> delivered a scathing amount of <strong>damning faint praise</strong> to the <strong>author</strong> and proclaimed by Alexander Pope, <strong>antiquarian, Thomas Hearne</strong>. 
	Specifically this is regarding the chonological and historical inaccuracies of his penned accounts of history and his hoarding nature. He performed this by making fun of his 
	percieved lack of intelligence, by providing numerous corrections to his works upon his death in a letter. Alexander Pope, while he was an avid user of the term 
	<strong>"damning with faint praise"</strong> also happens to behind the individual who <strong>coined the term</strong>.</p>
